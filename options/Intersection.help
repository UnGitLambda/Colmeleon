The Intersection algorithm takes two histograms as input. 
It compares the bins of each histogram and keeps only the smaller of the two. 
It treats all cases : 
- the histograms are either both color or both grey
- one histogram is color and the other is grey. 
The algorithm works even if the two histograms are not of the same size. A ratio has been set up, the largest histogram is scaling up to the smallest.
