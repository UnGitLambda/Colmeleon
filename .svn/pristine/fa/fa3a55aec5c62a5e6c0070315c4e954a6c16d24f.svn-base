The Incremental Intersection algorithm consist of an intersection with color axes described in the Swain and Ballard's article Color Indexing (1991)
This algorithm will create ‘bins histograms’  with the color axes as defined below :
rg = red - green
by = 2 * blue - red - green
wb = red + green + blue
The algorithm will beforehand create all necessary compact vector representing for each bins histograms.
Then when used, the algorithm will create the ‘bin histogram’ vector of the image and compare it to each vector in the database.
This algorithm differs from the normal intersection by using different color axes with fewer bins, and the pre-processing of the database before usage.
